## Hello, world! 👋

🖍️ **I'm Natalia, the social video editor at GitHub.**

🥯 I'm based in New Jersey, USA (more specifically, the Jersey shore!)
💬 I know a bunch about social media platforms, audience engagement, editing for social, bite-sized storytelling, trends, online community building and cat videos!
